# Py Me Up, Charlie
Two-part challenge that demonstrates my Python scripting skills. In PyBank I analyze the financial records of a company and in PyPoll assist a small town in modernizing their vote counting process by returning election results.

### PyBank
In part 1, I created a Python script that analyzes the records of a bank to calculate each of the following:

1. The total number of months included in the dataset
2. The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period
3. The changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period
4. The average of the changes in step 3
5. The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period
6. The greatest decrease in losses (date and amount) over the entire period
7. Printed the analysis to the terminal and export a text file with the results

### PyPoll
In part 2, I helped a small, rural town modernize its vote counting process by creating a Python script that analyzed the following:

1. The total number of votes cast
2. A complete list of candidates who received votes
3. The percentage of votes each candidate won
4. The total number of votes each candidate won
5. The winner of the election based on popular vote
6. Printed the analysis to the terminal and export a text file with the results
